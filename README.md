- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @A-kki
- I'm a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Information Technology, currently in my 5th semester. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with code and turning ideas into scalable solutions. Whether it's exploring algorithms, building full-stack applications, or diving into Web3 projects, I'm always up for the challenge.
